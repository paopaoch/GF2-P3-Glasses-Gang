# PEP8 Violation

Every python file in this folder is written according to PEP8 and PEP257. However, as error.py contains all the error messages which could be very long in character count, it does not make sense to follow PEP8 rule of 79 characters long. However, every other lines in the file which is not an error message do not violate this rule.
